Design Choices:

For my website mock-ups I wanted to embrace a dark theme for the site, while still utilizing the colours associated with the already established brand of Pokémon. 

The yellow used was a web-safe version of Pikachu yellow, the most iconic character and colour associated with the Pokémon brand and identity.

I chose a bright red icon to signify the Pokémon who have been marked as caught. This ensures they stand out, while having a really nice contrast against the dark backgrounds and bright yellow.

For headings, I chose to use the Pokémon-Solid font, to stay withing branding conventions and to make the site easily recognizable to new users. However, for more basic text such as Pokémon names and abilities, I chose Arial Rounded MT. This ensures all important information and text is easily readable.  



Report:

With the crunch of final assingments beginning to be handed out, paired with my eagerness to work, integrate, and test the Pokemon API with my site, i think those factors made me start to skip too far ahead. I didnt take the time to sit down give myself enough time to accuratly recreate my mock-up design using html and css as much as i would have liked. I also think perhapse i made my mock-up a little too detailed and aestetic, i wanted my site to look really good, and didnt think about how i was actually going to implement it. Which made it much more difficult on myself once i had to actually start coding. I regret those choices because while im happy with the product ive come up with now. Its not following the design as much as i had imagined. 

recources used include font awesome, this was used for the bookmark icon in the top right.



Updated report.
At this stage im very happy with the look and design of my site, the colours, fonts, and layout are all exactly how i imagined it. 

Functionally it works well, is mobile responsive. There are alerts to notify the user that a pokemon has been added to the favourites list, as well as telling them if a pokemon they attempt to favourite has already been added to their favourites list.

The major issue ive ran into here is displaying the favourited list of pokemon on the page. I began development thinking that the favourited pokemon should be listed in their own seperate page (which is why there is a favourites.html file in the root) but upon reading the instructions further, it notes that there should be only one html file. I am able to add and store the pokemon in the local storage, and keep them there upon refresh. But when it comes to displaying the favourited pokemon. They remain displayed at the bottom of index.html as undefined. I think there is an error in my naming which is causing this issue. But unfortunatly i dont have as much time to troubleshoot as much as i would like, as i must leave for work and will not be home until past the time of submission. With a little more time i think i could have perfected this assignment, but the content that i do have for submission i am very happy with.
