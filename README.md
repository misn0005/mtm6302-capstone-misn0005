Design Choices:

For my website mock-ups I wanted to embrace a dark theme for the site, while still utilizing the colours associated with the already established brand of Pokémon. 

The yellow used was a web-safe version of Pikachu yellow, the most iconic character and colour associated with the Pokémon brand and identity.

I chose a bright red icon to signify the Pokémon who have been marked as caught. This ensures they stand out, while having a really nice contrast against the dark backgrounds and bright yellow.

For headings, I chose to use the Pokémon-Solid font, to stay withing branding conventions and to make the site easily recognizable to new users. However, for more basic text such as Pokémon names and abilities, I chose Arial Rounded MT. This ensures all important information and text is easily readable.  



Report:

With the crunch of final assingments beginning to be handed out, paired with my eagerness to work, integrate, and test the Pokemon API with my site, i think those factors made me start to skip too far ahead. I didnt take the time to sit down give myself enough time to accuratly recreate my mock-up design using html and css as much as i would have liked. I also think perhapse i made my mock-up a little too detailed and aestetic, i wanted my site to look really good, and didnt think about how i was actually going to implement it. Which made it much more difficult on myself once i had to actually start coding. I regret those choices because while im happy with the product ive come up with now. Its not following the design as much as i had imagined. 

recources used include font awesome, this was used for the bookmark icon in the top right.
