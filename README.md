Design Choices:

For my website mock-ups I wanted to embrace a dark theme for the site, while still utilizing the colours associated with the already established brand of Pokémon. 

The yellow used was a web-safe version of Pikachu yellow, the most iconic character and colour associated with the Pokémon brand and identity.

I chose a bright red icon to signify the Pokémon who have been marked as caught. This ensures they stand out, while having a really nice contrast against the dark backgrounds and bright yellow.

For headings, I chose to use the Pokémon-Solid font, to stay withing branding conventions and to make the site easily recognizable to new users. However, for more basic text such as Pokémon names and abilities, I chose Arial Rounded MT. This ensures all important information and text is easily readable.
